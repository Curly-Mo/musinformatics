Musinformatics
====================================

A simple website for hosting some of my Music Informatics related python scripts

Live Url

Install python dependencies
---------------------------
```
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
```


Previewing the Application
--------------------------
To run locally:

```
python run.py
```

(currently requires python2, as one of the older scripts isn't ported over yet)
